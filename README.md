Introduction to geospatial capabilities
These examples introduce SageMaker geospatial capabilities which makes it easy to build, train, and deploy ML models using geospatial data.

How to use SageMaker Processing with geospatial image shows how to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) which indicates health and density of vegetation using SageMaker Processing and satellite imagery
